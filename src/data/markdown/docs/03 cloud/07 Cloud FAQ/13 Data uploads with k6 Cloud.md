The [test builder](/test-authoring/test-builder) and [script editor](/cloud/creating-and-running-a-test/script-editor) in the k6 Cloud do not allow to upload a data file in your test.

If you want to execute a cloud test that will upload a data file, you have to [run the cloud tests from the CLI](/cloud/creating-and-running-a-test/cloud-tests-from-the-cli) and follow the steps described on the [data uploads example](/examples/data-uploads).
