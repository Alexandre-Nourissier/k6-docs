excerpt: "List of the IP addresses used by the k6 cloud"
---

k6 uses AWS for cloud load generators. For the IP addresses used in the different load zones and filtering methods please refer directly to [Amazon](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html).

If you prefer to view the ranges directly, within the above link, the [ip-ranges.json](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json) file provides the updated list of IP addresses used by our load generators. In order to know which IP ranges can be used, you need to filter the `service` of type EC2 and the `region` of the selected load zone/s in your test configuration.

The zone codes are mapped as follows:
