## k6 as a CLI

One of the main features in k6 is its ability to act as a command line interface with k6 cloud. This makes it effortless to integrate into your CI/CD pipelines and making sure that your build is free of performance regressions.

Our [Integrations](/integrations) section contains guides for all major CI tools with more on the horizon.

## Converters

With k6 being an open source project, community contributed to multiple converters that make it easier to port your JMeter or Postman scripts to k6. Our Har to k6 converter can help you quickly convert HAR files exported from any browser or third party application.

There is more information available in our [Integrations](/integrations) section.
