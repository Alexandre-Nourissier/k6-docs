The Grafana data source plugin allows you to view your **test results stored in k6 Cloud** in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/). 

You can use the plugin in your self-hosted Grafana installation or run it with our ready-to-use Docker compose environment. Read the installation instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/k6io/k6-cloud-grafana-datasource).

You need to run the plugin and set your [Token](/cloud/integrations/token). Then, you can navigate all your k6 projects, find a test, select a test run and view the results with our predefined Dashboard.
