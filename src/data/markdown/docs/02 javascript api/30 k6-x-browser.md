[xk6-browser](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser) brings browser automation and end-to-end testing to k6 while supporting core k6 features. You can now mix browser interactions and protocol-based requests in your k6 tests.

<CodeGroup labels={[]}>

```javascript
import launcher from 'k6/x/browser';

export default function () {
  const browser = launcher.launch('chromium', { headless: false });
  const context = browser.newContext();
  const page = context.newPage();
  page.goto('http://whatsmyuseragent.org/');
  page.screenshot({ path: `example-chromium.png` });
  page.close();
  browser.close();
}

## APIs

`xk6-browser` uses [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) to instrument and interact with the browser. The API aims for compability with the [Playwright API](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright/):
