[xk6-browser](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser) brings browser automation and end-to-end testing to k6 while supporting core k6 features. You can now interact with the browser and collect frontend metrics as part of your k6 tests.

<CodeGroup labels={[]}>

```javascript
import launcher from 'k6/x/browser';

export default function () {
  const browser = launcher.launch('chromium', { headless: false });
  const context = browser.newContext();
  const page = context.newPage();
  page.goto('http://whatsmyuseragent.org/');
  page.screenshot({ path: `example-chromium.png` });
  page.close();
  browser.close();
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Installation

xk6-browser was initially developed as a [k6 extension](/extensions). You have to run a k6 version built with the browser extension to use the [xk6-browser API](#browser-apis) in your k6 tests.

```bash
# install xk6
go install github.com/grafana/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest

# build the k6 binary
xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-browser
```

## Browser APIs

`xk6-browser` uses [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) to instrument and interact with the browser. The `xk6-browser` APIs aims for rough compatibility with the [Playwright API for NodeJS](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright). 

Note that because k6 does not run in NodeJS, an `xk6-browser` API will slightly differ from its Playwright counterpart.
